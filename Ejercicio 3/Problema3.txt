EJERCICIO 3

You are standing on the OX-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0. You can make several jumps. 
Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and jump for the k-th time.

    a. You can:
        i. either jump to the point y+k or
        ii. jump to the point y−1.

What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?

INPUT
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer x (1≤x≤106) — the destination point.

OUTPUT
For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach x. It can be proved that we can reach 
any integer point x.
